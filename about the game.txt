is a card game for 2-4 players popular among backpackers, which is where I learnt how to play.

Although there are many variations on the rules, the basic gameplay is the same.

Players start with 3 face down, 3 face up, and 3 hand cards. Before play, players can swap any card or cards from their hand with their face down cards to try and get a better hand for later in the game.

Players then take turns to place cards on a pile. Each card must match or beat the rank of the last played card (Aces are high).

Some cards have a special meaning - for example, 10 (usually) clears the pile and allows the player to start again.

If a player is unable to play, they must pick up the cards.

I built the back end in Python with SQLite as the database. The front end is built using Bootstrap and JQuery. I make use of asynchronous calls between the front end and the back end to keep gameplay going.

In future I intend to replace the DBMS (e.g. move to Google Cloud SQL), optimise some of the SQL and database activities (e.g. simplify some queries, implement transactions etc.), add some play instructions, and host the game online at pooheadcardgame.com
